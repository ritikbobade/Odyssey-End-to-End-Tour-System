# Odyssey-End-to-End-Tour-System
To plan and execute efficient tour system. Sometimes, we want to travel, but donâ€™t know the destination. In this world where the most precious thing is time people want fast and easy process in everything, they do that will save their time. Planning a tour can be tiring and time-consuming process as people plan tours for different purpose and with different expectations and no system in present time provide them with less time-consuming process and separate tours for different types of people. One more problem what needs to be solved in the current touring system is the problem of less flexibility in the touring packages and very less changes can be made after the tour has started. In our model we are building a web app where users can get a tour package by comparing all the prices and packages provided by all the tourism websites. The user can customize their own tour plan according to their interests and budget. Based on different types of user groups present.
